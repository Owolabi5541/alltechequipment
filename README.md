# AllTech Equipment Brokerage â€” React + Tailwind (Vite)

Branding is wired in Tailwind and components. Replace the placeholder SVG logo later.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Pages

- `/` Home (Hero, selling points, CTAs)
- `/about` Mission, what we broker, why choose us, business card mockup placeholder
- `/services` Service list
- `/projects` Case studies
- `/testimonials` Client quotes
- `/contact` Contact info + form (client-side only for now)
- `/blog` Placeholder

## Branding

- Primary `#003366` (navy)
- Secondary `#6C7A89` (cool gray)
- Accent `#D2D7D3` (metallic silver)
- Typography: Tailwind default; headers are `font-semibold`

## To Do Later

- Replace Logo component with real SVG
- Hook contact form to backend or email service
- Add blog engine (e.g., markdown or headless CMS)
- Generate QR code for LinkedIn; export business card PDF/PNG
- SEO polish and analytics


- Just a quick one this project is build on client discription and to be handled a software engineer..
I am not concern with what the client use this for .
Thank you
